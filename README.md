# Weather_Analysis_Project
The objective of this project is to simulate and analyze daily temperature data over a year to identify seasonal trends, extreme temperatures, and overall climate patterns.

Key analyses include:
1. Computing average, maximum, and minimum temperatures
2. Identifying extreme temperature days using Boolean indexing
3. Visualizing trends with line graphs and histograms
4. Providing weather advisories based on temperature deviations
